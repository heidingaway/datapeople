# Gender of Person Reference Guide
This page brings together information available on gender from multiple sources for a better understanding of the term and to promote standards adoption and interoperability of data.

## Gender statistics

[Gender Statistics](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5298) includes a description, data sources and methodology.

## Surveys including gender

In 2018, Statistics Canada started collecting data on gender in social surveys, such as in the [Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5256). The [2021 Census of Population](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3901) included for the first time the question on gender and the "at birth" precision to the sex question which can be found in the [2021 Census: 2A](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/instrument/3901_Q1_V7) questionnaire. Gender is expected to be used by default in most social statistics programs at Statistics Canada in accordance with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's [Policy Direction to Modernize the Government of Canada's Sex and Gender Information Practices (2018)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/reports/summary-modernizing-info-sex-gender.html#h-6). Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman, or non-binary person while sex at birth is typically assigned at birth based on a person's reproductive system and other physical characteristics.

## Gender of person variable

[Gender of person](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=DEC&Id=410445) includes the definition, usage, conformity to relevant internationally recognized standards, classifications, additional information and previous version.

## Gender classifications

The [Classification of gender](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1326727) and the [Classification of cisgender, transgender and non-binary](http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1326715) outline the classification structure and include a link to the definitions and usage.
