# Watch this Spacetime from AstroKatie - June edition
## Comments
- [[Quantum 101 - Quantum Science Explained]]
- [[Cosmology 101 with Katie Mack]]
- early data shows possibility of [[Dynamic dark energy]] - Katie is avoiding getting hopes up as physics evolves faster than [[Love and loss in the time of colliders|seasonal fashion]]
- how do we know the distance to call something the [[NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope Finds Most Distant Known Galaxy|most distant galaxy]]? when you see “the most distant galaxy” you should really think “the highest [[Cosmological Redshift|redshift]] galaxy”. Astronomers don't really talk in terms of most distance, but instead colour stated as a number related to the stretching of the cosmos.
