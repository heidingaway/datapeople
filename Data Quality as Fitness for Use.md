#  Data Quality as Fitness for Use
## Comments
- "We all deal with data every day, but we do not always use data to their full potential. This course introduces a clear and easy-to-use framework to help you to:
	- define your data need
	- assess the fitness of a potential data source for your specific purpose
	- make a decision about whether a potential data source is in fact, fit for your specific purpose"[^1]
