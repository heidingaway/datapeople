# PSE 910 Grievances
**Description:** This bank describes personal information related to the grievance process, through which employees may formally seek redress/resolution of any disagreements pertaining to terms and conditions of employment. In addition to the formal process, this bank also describes personal information related to any informal conflict management process. Personal information may include name, contact information, employee personnel information, biographical information, educational information, employee identification number, employment equity information, nature of the grievance, medical information; opinions and views of, or about, individuals; and signature.

**Note:** For those institutions subject to the Public Service Labour Relations Act, section 208 of the Act gives an employee the right to present an individual grievance unless an administrative procedure for redress is provided under any Act of Parliament, other than the Canadian Human Rights Act.

**Class of Individuals:** Current and past employees of government institutions, their representatives or bargaining agents, and any other witness or individual who may be involved in the grievance process including individuals who serve as mediators, adjudicators, or arbitrators.

**Purpose:** Personal information is used for informal conflict resolution and/or to administer individual or group grievances at each of the levels in the grievance process. For most government institutions, personal information is collected pursuant to sections 207 and 208 of the Public Service Labour Relations Act and sections 66 and 76 of the Public Service Labour Relations Board Regulations. For those institutions not subject to the Act or Regulations, consult the institution’s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator to determine the legal authority for the collection.

**Consistent Uses:** Information concerning grievances filed under the Public Service Labour Relations Act may be shared with the Public Service Labour Relations Board (refer to Central Personal Information Banks: [Applications for Extension of Time - PSLRB PCE 710](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp), [Applications for an extension of time in respect of a grievance - PSLRB PCE 715](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp), [Complaint/Grievance Mediation - PSLRB PCE 726](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp), [Complaints under Section 190 of the Public Service Labour Relations Act (PSLRA) - RLT PCE 730](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp), and [Requests for Review of Decisions – PSLRB PCE 793](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp). Certain complaints may be referred to mediation, adjudication, or arbitration by the Public Service Labour Relations Board (refer to Central Personal Information Banks: [References of Grievances to Adjudication - PSLRB PCE 791](http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/infosource_e.asp) and [Reference to Adjudication of Individual Grievances - PSLRB PCE 792](http://pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/reports/intro_e.asp)). In these cases, information may be disclosed to individuals who are appointed by the Public Service Labour Relations Board or by a government institution to serve as mediators, adjudicators or arbitrators. Full-text versions of decisions are posted on the Public Service Labour Relations Board website. In some cases, information may be shared with the Canadian Human Rights Commission where a party to a grievance raises an issue involving the interpretation or application of the Canadian Human Rights Act within the context of a request for arbitration of the grievance. Aggregate information may be used or disclosed for annual reporting purposes. Some information about grievances may also be shared with/described in Standard Personal Information Banks [Employee Personnel Record - PSE 901](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse901) and [Discipline - PSE 911](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse911).
