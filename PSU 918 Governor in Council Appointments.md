**Class of Individuals:** Current and former appointees and their family members.

**Purpose:** The personal information collected is used to support the identification and selection of individuals to serve as Governor in Council appointments which include Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of Crown Corporations, Heads of Agencies, and Boards of Governors. Successful individuals are named through an Order in Council - a process that is managed by the Privy Council Office. The personal information is also used to manage the administration of expenses (e.g., travel) and compensation and benefits packages, conduct performance evaluations, maintain an inventory of current and former appointees, record potential conflicts of interest and any compliance action required, and to communicate with these individuals.

**Consistent Uses:** Personal information about the appointee is contained in the Order in Council document which includes full name, contact information, the position to which s/he is being appointed, the length and tenure of the appointment, and the terms and conditions of the appointment (e.g., remuneration, benefits, vacation leave, etc.). This information is provided by the Privy Council Office to the institution (refer to [Governor in Council Personnel Records - PCO PPU 020](http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=info-source/index-eng.htm)).

Additionally, this information may be used in the preparation of reports for senior management and broader audiences (e.g., Annual Reports) and communications materials (e.g., press releases, biographies, etc.) that may be disseminated in multiple formats, including the institution’s website. In some instances, the Privy Council Office receives notes and performance ratings to support the conduct of performance evaluations of selected individuals (refer to [Governor in Council Personnel Records - PCO PPU 020](http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=info-source/index-eng.htm)).
