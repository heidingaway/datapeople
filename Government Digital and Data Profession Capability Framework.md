## How to use this framework

The name of this guidance changed on 1 December 2023. Previously its name was ‘Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Profession Capability Framework’. This change reflects the [launch of the new brand for Government Digital and Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-skills-rebrand-to-attract-top-tech-talent-to-civil-service).

Anyone can use this framework to:

- learn what the different digital and data roles do in government
- understand what skills are needed at each role level

Professionals in Government Digital and Data can use this framework to:

- identify skills that they can develop
- assess their current skill levels in preparation for performance and development conversations
- learn about the typical responsibilities and skills of their colleagues

Line managers and team leaders in government can use this framework to:

- identify skill gaps in their teams and opportunities for development
- inform development goals and conversations
- forecast their organisation workforce needs, to make sure they have the right skills to achieve objectives

Hiring managers in government can use this framework to:

- create effective and consistent job adverts
- assess the suitability of a candidate during interview

## Skills in this framework

Each role level (such as junior business analyst or senior business analyst) in this framework includes a list of required skills. Each skill is assigned one of 4 skill levels, reflecting the required proficiency: awareness, working, practitioner or expert.

As you progress from one role level to the next, the proficiency required for each skill will typically increase (other than in instances where leadership positions no longer require day-to-day use of the skill).

You can see the full list of skills and their definitions in the [Skills A to Z](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/skills).

| Skill level | What the level means |
| --- | --- |
| Awareness  Awareness is the first of 4 ascending skill levels | You can:  - describe the fundamentals of the skill - demonstrate basic knowledge of some of the skill's tools and techniques |
| Working  Working is the second of 4 ascending skill levels | You can:  - apply the skill with some support - adopt the most appropriate tools and techniques |
| Practitioner  Practitioner is the third of 4 ascending skill levels | You can:  - apply the skill without support - determine and use the most appropriate tools and techniques - share knowledge and experience of the skill |
| Expert  Expert is the fourth of 4 ascending skill levels | You can:  - lead and guide a team or organisation in the skill's best practice - teach the skill's advanced tools and techniques |

### Skills for chief digital and data roles

Chief digital and data roles (such as chief technology officer or chief data officer) do not have role levels and so their skills do not have levels. Instead, each skill lists digital and data requirements together with examples of leadership needed to be effective in a Senior Civil Service role.

## Support

The Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework is maintained by the [Central Digital and Data Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office).
