# BSC - Interacting with adults
## Definition
- [[Mr. Redmont]] provides series introduction to adults in the BSC world, he is stiff, formal, and expects adherence to rules that do not necessarily appear to be well understood by the kids[^1] eg. Kristy understanding she broke a rule as soon as she acted, but not having any idea of what the offense was until he explained it. He uses a word "decorum" which Kristy did not understand, but she chooses to say "yes, sir" twice instead of clarifying. In the meantime, her internal monologue she is thinking of ways that seemed to have worked in the past to restore her good standing with "adult world", but she says "this sometimes helps", "being polite sometimes helps" because she does not have clarity[^1]
