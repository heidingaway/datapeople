## Definition
- when reading there may be text we wish to highlight or jot down for future reference
- add context and and help remember the thought you had when reading or writing the info
- Why did I write this down in the first place
- Add context to include book title, author, chapter, page number
- Each note is a single idea, rather than collection of learnings from what you read
