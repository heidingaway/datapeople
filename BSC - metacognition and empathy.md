# BSC - metacognition and empathy
## Kristy
- generally very thoughtful and understands divergent perspectives in retrospect, but often acts without thinking first; frequently in trouble for impulsive actions[^1]
- Adept at navigating interactions with adults from being in trouble frequently, but also has great awareness of the emotions of the adults[^2] [[BSC - Interacting with adults]]
- It becomes clear that a lot of her awareness is due to her mother who she still defers to for understanding of the world[^3]

[^1]: [[Kristy's Great Idea - Ann M Martin]], pg 6: "I felt bad, but I couldn't help what I'd done. I'm like that. I think of something to say, and I say it. I think of something to do, and I do it. Mom calls it impulsive. Sometimes she calls it trouble. But she doesn't just mean trouble. She means *trouble*."
[^2]: Martin, pg. 6: "Mr. Redmont looked shocked. He was probably thinking he'd been so nice letting us make fans, and there I was, not appreciating it at all, jut glad the day was over."
