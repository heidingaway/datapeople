**Class of Individuals:** Employees and former employees of the institution who are/were the subject of the alleged misconduct, interviewees, medical practitioners, representatives or bargaining agents, and witnesses.

**Purpose:** Personal information is used to investigate alleged misconduct in government institutions and to determine the need for, and nature of, disciplinary actions.

For many institutions, personal information is collected pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(c) of the Financial Administration Act. For those institutions not subject to the Act, consult the institution’s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator to determine the legal authority for the collection.

**Consistent Uses:** Some discipline measures may also be described in Standard Personal Information Bank [Employee Personnel Record - PSE 901](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse901).
