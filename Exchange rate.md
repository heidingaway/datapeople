# Exchange rate
> The value of the [[Canadian dollar]] rises or falls according to how much people in foreign exchange markets want to buy and sell it—that’s what makes it float.
>
> The [[Bank of Canada]] doesn’t try to set the dollar’s exchange rate. We let markets set its value. Because the Bank of Canada lets the Canadian dollar float, we can focus on setting interest rates to maintain inflation at 2 percent in Canada.[^1]
