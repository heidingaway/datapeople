## Process
Capture
- Save anything that resonates with you, don't overthink it, it will be refined over time
Organize
- organize the information based on most actionable to least actionable using the [[PARA classification system]]
- Follow the [[Triaging by actionability]] process
- create a temporary holding area where new items can accumulate to be sorted at a daily interval (or weekly)
Distill
- distill your notes into actionable bitesized summaries
- Over time, the centralization will naturally reveal patterns and connections 
- [[Designing Notes for Your Future Self]] 

Express
- Â turn our knowledge into effective action
