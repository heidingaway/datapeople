# Free Agents
Some may have already heard by now, but the context for my initiating my search for a long term home was being surprised by the news 2 weeks ago that TBS was pulling out of participating in the Free Agents program over the next year. To be clear, the Free Agents program continues to exist at NRCan. There seems to be no indication that they are or will be in the same situation. NRCan is the original department in which the CFA began as a pilot. When I read about the first cohort back in 2017, I said this is how I want to spend my career.

It became a bit of a north star; I focused on building up my skills and confidence to have a highly mobile public service career. Back then I didn't qualify back, in the literal sense, but also in believing in myself, my skills, and my thinking to put myself out there and hustled for new assignments and building a network in the way that is necessary to be successful when you are responsible for finding a funding source for your own position. By the time I was successful in the recruitment process, I was such a different person and had moved around as it was that I wondered if I would benefit from being a Free Agent. But even as my time in the Free Agents is ending, I can still confidently say I do not regret a single thing about that decision.

There's a lot I could say as part of the postmortem that has been endlessly turning over in my head in the last 2 weeks, and at times in the last 2 years as a Free Agent (I've filled out a lot, A LOT of HR paperwork), some with big feelings attached. There's probably a lesson learned here about data, metrics, and targets, in the recent push for FTE reductions. Goodhart's Law is something that has come up quite a lot in our Wednesday Data Drop-in discussions - it's certainly has been on my mind the last few weeks. I think what it comes down to is this...

  We were here. The work we did mattered. But we were always more than the sum of our parts. The Free Agents program brought us together, gave us permission chase the change we wanted to see. And perhaps a bit of protection to become comfortable as an asker of uncomfortable questions and (although fear still overcomes me sometimes...) a confronter of bad behaviour.

This last part has certainly been critical for my staying in the public service. It gave me the safety I needed to start setting boundaries and demand to be treated as a human in a bureaucracy that prefers widgets. That is the thing I will carry forward, the ongoing and iterative practice that helps protect and sustain more inclusive and more spaces. (The caveat of "more" being that no space will be 100% safe for 100% of people. It is a function of dialogue and dialectic.)

Yesterday, we had a session with a group who wanted to tell us about the opportunities they had for the affected agents. We started with a round of introductions for each person. Although I've had the opportunity to get to know many of these folks that last few years, it was astonishing how much talent was in a single room with only a portion of the affected agents present. In fact, more than one person commented on it.

  So. The point is this: myself and more than 20 of my friends will need to find a new substantive position and we have 50 weeks to do it. I truly appreciate all of the folks that have reached out to me already to discuss opportunities and offer support and a space to feel a lot of feelings in the time since. Even if you are not particularly interested in me but have other opportunities for some very talent people, I know where to find at least 20 of them.
