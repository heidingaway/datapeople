# what is doing data
What does it mean to “do” data? What exactly is the point of all these data strategies to improve how we approach data?

It’s all about making the right information/evidence available to the right people at the right time who have the appropriate tools and authority to make the best possible decision. Where there’s written laws or rules, decision making could be fairly straight forward. Killing someone is against the rules; you choose to not to kill someone. In this case, there’s probably some moral and religious dimension that you account for in making this decision…
