## Process
How do I make what I'm consuming now easily discoverable for my future self?

- defining key terms in case we forget what they mean
- Inserting placeholders when we leave off so we know where to pick up
- Add links to related websites, files, emails that we're likely to forget over time
- Summerize progressively, at different levels of details - summarize the best bit, bold the important parts, highlight the essential information to help make it increasingly **scannable**
- Add a bit of value to a note every time you touch it (ie. adding links to other notes, highlighting some points, holding some points)
