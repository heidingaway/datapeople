# Astrobio Defense
## Definition
- I first encountered this term through Phil's LinkedIn Post[^2] on updated guidance from the WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Biosafety warning[^3] on "how artificial intelligence, cyber attacks and genetic engineering could pose potentially catastrophic biosecurity threats to countries around the world". 
-  biological threats emerging at the intersection of space exploration and infectious disease.
