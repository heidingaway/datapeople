## Comments
- data to date had been consistent on dark energy being a [[constant dark energy|cosmological constant]]
- first results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) showed that dark energy might not be as constant as we thought - dark energy may be getting less powerful over time
