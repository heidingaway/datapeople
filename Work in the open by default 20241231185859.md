## What is open by default?

Working in the open by default means making your work, such as processes, decisions and content of business value, freely available with minimal restrictions.

## Why is this important?

Working in the open by default is integral to the culture of government integrity. It promotes transparency and fosters trust by ensuring that information and processes are available to all. It encourages collaboration and accountability because open access allows for greater scrutiny and feedback.

## How to do it

These are suggested steps on how to work in the open by default. Depending on where you’re at in your process, you might not need to follow every step.

Discover

- **Define what information should be shared in the open.** Develop processes and guidelines for working in the open. Determine the security classification of your information, and clearly define what information, documents and processes can be shared openly.
- **Find the right degree of openness.** Depending on the scope of your product, determine whether degrees of openness could be considered, such as open access with an open licence, public access with a specific licence that limits use, group-based access through authentication or named access explicitly assigned by contract. To help you find the right degree of openness, consult the *Access to Information Act* and the *Directive on Open Government*.
- **Prioritize transparency.** From the outset, assess current transparency levels, identify gaps and set clear expectations making it obvious that your product will prioritize transparency and work in the open.
- **Do open research.** Engage with the public by sharing your research findings and key insights in the open. Use platforms like Canada.ca blog, Alpha and Service Canada Labs to publish your data, allowing others to view and contribute to it.

Build

- **Use open platforms and tools.** Ensure transparency in your product development by hosting your product code, design assets and documentation on open repositories like GitHub, Alpha or Service Canada Labs. Ensure proper version control and establish guidelines for managing contributions.
- **Share early and often.** Share your product roadmaps, prototypes and mock-ups in the open. Update these artifacts regularly to reflect progress and changes, and to keep stakeholders engaged with your product’s direction while enabling them to iterate on their own products.
- **Document everything.** Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of decisions, processes and progress. Make this documentation accessible and easy to navigate.

Test

- **Invite user testing.** Conduct open user testing sessions where community members can participate. Collect feedback openly, making the results available for everyone involved. Test your product on open testing platforms like GitHub, Alpha, or Service Canada Labs.
- **Share updates.** Share regular updates on testing progress, including any bugs found and resolved through open channels like Slack or Microsoft (MS) Teams.

Monitor and iterate

- **Invite continuous feedback.** Open lines of communication to gather user feedback on your product, such as surveys or community forums, where users and stakeholders can share their needs and expectations. Use collaborative tools like GCconnex, GCcollab or GCxchange to facilitate open dialogue. Encourage users to report issues, suggest features or contribute directly to improving your product.
- **Publish your performance measures in the open.** Publishing your performance measures in the open is ideal as this can help mitigate risks.
- **Be open about what you prioritize.** Share your prioritization process openly, allowing users to vote or comment on what features or fixes your team should address.
- **Encourage open decision-making.** Hold public discussions on any necessary changes or iterations so that everyone involved has a say on the features of your product. Use forums or open meetings to allow users and stakeholders to voice their opinions. Do this before making any decisions on the outcomes of your product.
- **Iterate in the open.** Document and share each iteration or update of the product. Explain what changes were made and why, keeping users and stakeholders engaged throughout your product’s life cycle.
