# Registered Education Savings Plans and related benefits
> The Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is a **long-term savings plan** to help people save for a child's education after high school, including trade schools, CEGEPs, colleges, universities, and apprenticeship programs. An adult can also open an RESP for themselves.

> When you open an RESP, you can ask your financial institution (the promoter) to apply for benefits like the **[[Canada Learning Bond]] (CLB)** and the **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)**. If the child is eligible, these benefits will be received in the RESP to help with the cost of the child's education. Eligible expenses can include tuition, books, tools, transportation, and rent. British Columbia and Quebec also offer provincial benefits.[^1]
