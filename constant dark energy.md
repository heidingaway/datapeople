## Comments
- The universe is expanding and the expansion is speeding up.
- Accelerated expansion is unexpected if only matter and energy are present and in context of gravitational laws.
- [[Einstein's General Relativity| Einstein originally proposed]] a cosmological constant, [[dark energy]], to counteract gravity, assuming a static universe. Removed after he learned the universe is expanding.
- an expanding universe with no cosmological constant, expansion should be decelerating. After the [[Big Bang]] which propelled the initial expansion, gravity becomes the only relevant force. Gravity always pulls things together. 
- Cosmological constant worked because it adds swelling into every bit of space. Once there is sufficiently big universe, gravitational pull of matter becomes relatively weak. Swelling becoming the dominant force then accelerates expansion. 
- Alternative theory: [[Dynamic dark energy]]
