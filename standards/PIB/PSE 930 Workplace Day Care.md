# PSE 930 Workplace Day Care

**Description:** The records containing information described in this standard bank may contain information collected from employee surveys conducted by government institutions for the purpose of estimating employee demand for workplace day care and from workplace day care centre records for evaluating the workplace day care policy. Such information may include employee or user personal data, data on their children, anticipated demand for day care and probability and reasons for enrolling a child in an institutionally sponsored workplace day care centre.

**Class of Individuals:** All federal employees included in Schedules I and IV of the Financial Administration Act.

**Purpose:** These records are to be used to determine whether sufficient employer interest and demand exist to merit further consideration (viability study) by the government institution of the possibility of establishing a workplace day care centre. They will be used to determine the level of ongoing federal rental support for the workplace day care centre. This information will also be used for the purposes of evaluating the day care centre policy.

**Consistent Uses:** The information in these records will be used for administrative and statistical purposes associated with the establishment of a day care centre. It will also be used for the evaluation and monitoring of the federal public service workplace day care policy. The information may be disclosed to Treasury Board, the government institution, an authorized committee of the government institution, a custodian government institution and the Board of Directors of the Day Care Centre. Together with the linked information from the files identified below, this information will form the basis for tabulations of the extent and type of employee day care users.

**Retention and Disposal Standards:** For information about the length of time that specific types of common administrative records are maintained by a government institution, including the final disposition of those records, please contact the institution’s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator.
