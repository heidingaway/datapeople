## Overview

For years, Statistics Canada has been providing Canadians with big picture statistics on a variety of topics impacting people across the country. However, the big picture can hide key differences in the experiences of specific population groups.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how a single event can be experienced differently across various groups, revealing uneven social and economic realities. To address how different groups have different lived experiences, more detailed data is needed, which can be broken down, or disaggregated, into sub-categories according to gender, ethnocultural characteristics, age, sexual orientation, disability – or intersections of these and other sub-categories. Data also needs to be broken down to the lowest possible level of geography, since events impact people differently depending on where they geographically live.

To produce this detailed disaggregated data, the Disaggregated Data Action Plan (DDAP) was launched with $172 million in funding over five years. A whole-of-government approach led by Statistics Canada, DDAP aims to increase and improve statistics on diverse populations, and to support more representative data collection methods.

These increased and improved disaggregated statistics will give all levels of government, businesses, policy specialists, data users, non-for-profit organizations, and all Canadians the level of detail they need to make evidence-based decisions. By informing policy decisions, these data will strengthen the government's efforts to address systemic racism and gender gaps and help create a more equitable Canada.

## DDAP target audience

The DDAP targets the four employment equity groups:

- Indigenous peoples
- Women
- Visible Minorities / Racialized populations
- Persons with disabilities

However, where relevant and possible, disaggregation is extended to other groups (e.g., sexual orientation, children and youth, seniors, official language, immigrants, low-income Canadians).

## DDAP's four guiding principles

![ ](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/sites/default/files/images/ddap-disaggregation.png)

**Disaggregation:**
Data will be disaggregated at the lowest level of population detail possible, while including Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) considerations and respecting quality and confidentiality.

**Intersectionality:**
Analysis will focus on intersectionality (e.g., young, Black, women) as opposed to dual combinations (e.g., young, women).

**Standards:**
Statistics Canada's approved standards will be used for disaggregation across all programs.

**Geography:**
Data will be released at the lowest level of geography possible.

## How do we produce more detailed data?

First, Statistics Canada securely combines its census and survey data with data already collected by other federal or provincial / territorial organizations. Data from other organizations are called 'administrative data' and this process of data combination is called 'data linkage'. Data linkages create an opportunity to access more accurate information and conduct comprehensive analyses. It also reduces the number of surveys Canadians are asked to complete.

After creating data linkages, data is then broken down (or disaggregated) into sub-categories according to a combination of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, and geography. Through this disaggregation, Statistics Canada can increase insights on diverse groups of people, thus shedding light on inequities, and promoting fairness and inclusion in decision-making.

## Progress so far

Through DDAP, Statistics Canada is working with Canadians to produce better data for better decision-making.

In 2023-2024, nearly half (49%) of analytical products released on the [economic](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?subject_levels=36), [social](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?subject_levels=45), and [health](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?subject_levels=13) domains included disaggregated data. On the employment and labour data, for instance, our breakdown in disaggregating data shows that employed young women aged 15 to 24 are the demographic group most likely to work [part-time involuntarily for economic reasons](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/14-28-0001/2023001/article/00002-eng.htm). Also, by combining the [Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHECs)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microdata/data-centres/data/canchec) with administrative health and mailing data, Statistics Canada was also able to release an [analysis of mortality by income and education](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/231123/dq231123e-eng.htm).

Statistics Canada has enhanced its disaggregated data by adding new survey questions and increasing sample sizes. For example, significant progress was made in producing detailed labour force population projections for the [Labour Force Survey](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/labour_) and the [Demosim Microsimulation Model](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/17200001), while also informing the [modernization of the *Official Languages Act*](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/canadians-official-languages-act.html). The DDAP Administrative Data Fund facilitated collaborations with external partners, funding initiatives to improve disaggregated data collection, including with the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure, the Nova Scotia Department of Justice, and four Canadian universities.

To enhance policy analysis, Statistics Canada developed online courses focused on utilizing disaggregated data effectively in public policy, including the two-part course entitled “[The Importance of Disaggregated Data: An Introduction](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/wtc/data-literacy/catalogue/892000062024001)”. Also, support for further geographic analysis has also been developed through a [methodological article](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/18-001-x/18-001-x2024001-eng.htm). Geographic analysis allows more nuanced information to be published on the different living experiences of individuals living in those areas.

Statistics Canada has harmonized standards related to [sexual orientation of person](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=DEC&Id=1223774). New dashboards were launched, including the [Municipal Quality of Life](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2023025-eng.htm) and [Municipal Diversity](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2024015-eng.htm) dashboards, allowing users to compare socioeconomic characteristics across jurisdictions more comfortably.

The [Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3302) has been updated to better capture Indigenous and racialized identity information, following extensive stakeholder consultations. The [Crime and Justice Statistics Portal](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/crime_and_justice) on Statistics Canada’s website now includes a dedicated section on the UCR expansion, offering the public full access to its progress.

## Keeping your data safe

All information collected through Statistics Canada's censuses and surveys, as well as administrative data from third parties, is protected by law under the [*Statistics Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-19/fulltext.html), the [*Access to Information Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/) and the [*Privacy Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/). We take the confidentiality and privacy of Canadians very seriously.
