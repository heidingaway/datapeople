## ubiquity and interconnectedness

Indicators of the impact that a reduction, deterioration or breakdown of a payment service provider’s (PSP’s) retail payment activities could have on end users and on other PSPs. Information the Bank of Canada would use to establish a PSP’s ubiquity and interconnectedness includes:

- the number of end users to which the PSP provides retail payment activities;
- the value of end-user funds held by the PSP;
- the value of electronic funds transfers in relation to which the PSP performed a retail payment activity;
- the number of electronic funds transfers in relation to which the PSP performed a retail payment activity; and
- the number of PSPs to which the PSP provides retail payment activities.
