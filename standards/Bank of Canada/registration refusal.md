# registration refusal
## registration refusal

Determination by the Bank of Canada that an applicant does not meet the criteria in the _[Retail Payment Activities Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/r-7.36/FullText.html)_ (RPAA) for registration and is not in scope of the Bank’s ongoing supervision, or should otherwise be refused registration at the Bank’s discretion in certain circumstances.

The Bank’s authority to refuse to register an applicant is set out in:

- paragraphs 48(1)(a)–(g) and subsection 48(2) of the RPAA, and
- subparagraphs 30(b)(i)–(ii) of the _[Retail Payment Activities Regulations](https://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2023/2023-11-22/html/sor-dors229-eng.html?)_ (RPAR).

The Minister of Finance may also issue a directive to the Bank to refuse to register an applicant for any of the reasons cited in section 40 of the RPAA. Where such a directive is issued, the Bank must refuse the applicant pursuant to section 49 of the RPAA.

Such applicants are listed as a refused entity and explicitly notified by the Bank not to perform payment services as they are not registered. The Bank monitors these individuals and entities to ensure their compliance with the registration requirements under section 23 of the RPAA.
