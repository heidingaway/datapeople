## registration revocation

Revoking of a payment service provider’s (PSP’s) registration with the Bank of Canada under the _[Retail Payment Activities Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/r-7.36/FullText.html)_ (RPAA). This action is taken by the Bank for reasons set out in section 52 of the RPAA and section 33 of the _[Retail Payment Activities Regulations](https://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2023/2023-11-22/html/sor-dors229-eng.html?)_ (RPAR) or by the Minister of Finance for reasons set out in subsection 45(1) the RPAA.

The Bank’s authority to revoke a PSP’s registration is set out in subsection 53(2), section 54, subsection 55(1) and subsection 56(1) of the RPAA.

Such applicants are listed as a revoked entity and explicitly notified by the Bank not to perform payment services as they are not registered. The Bank monitors these individuals and entities to ensure their compliance with the registration requirements under section 23 of the RPAA.
