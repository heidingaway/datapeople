## notice of default

An official record or notice issued by the Bank of Canada to a payment service provider (PSP) to indicate that:

- the Bank considers the PSP has not complied with a s. 76 compliance agreement (76CA)
- the PSP is liable to pay the difference between the administrative monetary penalty (AMP) set out in the notice of violation and any portion of the reduced AMP that was paid, plus an additional AMP equal to 100% of the original AMP.
