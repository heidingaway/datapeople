## PARA classification system 
1. Projects
	- Short term objectives, most actionable
	- Multi step tasks
	- 5-15 things you are actively working on
	- Goal oriented (ie. buy a house, finish a sweater)
2. Areas
	- very long lived, but actionable
	- Standard oriented rather than goal oriented
	- eg. managing finances, managing health, managing house
	- the standard is having a safe comfortable home, this would have ongoing regularly repeating tasks associated with maintaining that standard
3. Resources
	- store information that you are curious about, but have no immediate actions associated with it
	- Richard Feynman's 12 favourite problems - constantly present, but largely dormant questions that he returned to over and over again in his research
	- How might we bridge the digital divide?
	- How might we drive effective and lasting change to create a data-driven digital enabled government?
	- How might we restore public trust in government?
	- How might we drive effective and lasting change to build an inclusive future?
	- How might we create space for the integration of knowledge in seemingly unconnected domain for truly interdisciplinary solutions?
	- How might we encourage one another to be curious, critically thinking, engaged, and responsible citizens?
	- How might we realize the promise of automation to create a society in which labour (vs work and vs action) is not the sole purpose and orientation of human life?
4. Archive
	- old projects, completed tasks, past interests
	- No longer fit into an area of our life and no active project
	- Keeping old information while removing from visual clutter
