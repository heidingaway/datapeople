PARA classification system 
1. Projects
	- Short term objectives, most actionable
	- Multi step tasks
	- 5-15 things you are actively working on
	- Goal oriented (ie. buy a house, finish a sweater)
2. Areas
	- very long lived, but actionable
	- Standard oriented rather than goal oriented
	- eg. managing finances, managing health, managing house
	- the standard is having a safe comfortable home, this would have ongoing regularly repeating tasks associated with maintaining that standard
3. Resources
	- store information that you are curious about, but have no immediate actions associated with it
