| 33  | Ensuring findability of data.                                   | Data  | Relies on individual staff memberâ€™s knowledge to make find data and make it available to those who need it. Finding data is ad hoc and inefficient.        | Documents critical data sets in a central location, with a location of the data set. Relies on ad hoc processes or substantial specialist support to make data available to those who need it.                                                    | Documents all critical and some important data sets in a central location, with a location of the data set. The data is available to those who need it through efficient, structured routes. Some data requires specialist support to access. | Documents all critical and important data sets in a central location, with the location of the data set. The data is available to those who need it through efficient, structured, well-communicated routes. Most data can be accessed without specialist support.                                                          | Documents all critical and important data sets and makes them fully findable by all authorised users. Users are consistently able to access the data they need without specialist support.                                                                                                                             |
| 34  | Managing disposal of data in the right way.                     | Data  | Complies with minimum legal requirements for archiving of data. Disposal of data is ad hoc and does not consider the value or retention needs of the data. | Plans for organised disposal of data, but does not consider different value and sensitivity of data or retention needs for different data sets. Consistently records established processes for disposal of data and ownership of those processes. | Links the retention period for data in high profile data assets to the long-term value, sensitivity and context of the data. Records processes for disposal of the data alongside the data asset.                                             | Automates disposal of data in line with legal requirements and the long-term value of the data. Documents processes for data disposal clearly, and reviews them in tandem with changes to the data.                                                                                                                         | Proactively considers the requirements and processes for end-of-lifecycle disposal of data at the beginning of the data lifecycle. Consistently balances user needs with requirements for long-term preservation of data when implementing data initiatives.                                                           |
| 35  | Recording the data you hold, and ensuring people can access it. | Data  | Has no formal record of the data that the organisation holds. Nobody is aware or interested in the data assets in the organisation.                        | Has a basic register of data assets. The process for how to record data in the register is not described, supported or monitored. There is no public layer to the records and the register cannot be accessed by those who need it.               | Has a register of data assets with standardised processes. The register can be accessed by request at the discretion of the accountable party with no consistent, communicated process in place for this.                                     | Has a comprehensive and standardised register of data assets with efficient and appropriately governed internal access. Exploring processes for a public access layer for transparency of the nature assets held by the organisation that cannot be accessed directly, but this may be poorly communicated.                 | Has a comprehensive, standardised, and visible register of data assets with efficient and appropriately governed internal and external access. A public access layer supports transparency around data assets that require limited access.                                                                             |
| 36  | Keeping good metadata.                                          | Data  | Has metadata for some data sets. Where metadata is present it is often incomplete or out of date.                                                          | Has metadata for most high priority data sets, however it may be incomplete and is not updated in tandem with changes to the data. Metadata does not account for user needs.                                                                      | Includes information in metadata regarding where and when the data was collected or acquired, accounting for licencing that may affect long-term preservation. Metadata format and structure is standardised to some degree.                  | Includes information in metadata regarding why the data set was created or acquired, and the purposes and users for which the data set was created. Marks sensitivity of data in critical data sets, but this may be inconsistent across the organisation. Standardises metadata based on some understanding of user needs. | Actively maintains and updates metadata in tandem with changes to the data for all known data sets. Supports prevention of mosaic re-identification when combined with other data in archives by marking sensitivity of data clearly. Standardises metadata based on an in-depth understanding of user and data needs. |
