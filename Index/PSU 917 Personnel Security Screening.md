Individuals seeking access to their information in PSU 917 may also want to request that other institutional PIBs related to security screening be included in the access to information request if they have worked in or for the following departments which maintain separate PIBs: [Public Services and Procurement Canada (Industry Personnel Clearance and Reliability Records – PWGSC PPU 015)](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/aiprp-atip/infosource2014-eng.html); [National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces (Personnel Security Investigation File – DND PPU 834)](https://www.forces.gc.ca/en/transparency-access-info-privacy/info-source-toc.page); [Privy Council Office (Security Clearance and Assessments Bank – PCO PPE 801)](http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=info-source/index-eng.htm); [Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Security Reliability Screening Records – RCMP PPU 065)](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/atip-aiprp/infosource/pib-frp-eng.htm); and [Canadian Security Intelligence Service (Employee Security – SIS PPE 815)](https://www.csis.gc.ca/tp/nfsrc-en.php).

**Class of Individuals**: Job applicants, all current and former employees (students, agency and casual employees, persons on loan, assignment or secondment, exempt staff of ministers, ministers of state and parliamentary secretaries, locally engaged staff), volunteers, contractors, foreign and domestic visitors, immediate relatives, current and former spouse/common law partner, associates, cohabitants, individuals who give character references (including neighbours), current/former employers, parents or guardians of job applicants and employees under the age of 18.

**Purpose**: Personal information described in this bank is used to support decisions for granting, denying, revoking, or reviewing for cause the reliability status, security clearance, site access status or site access clearance of individuals working or applying to work through appointment, assignment or contract or other individuals with whom government may share or provide access to sensitive or information or assets, or access to facilities. For most institutions, personal information is collected pursuant to section 7 of the Financial Administration Act and as required under the Standard on Security Screening. That authority carries with it the authority to perform security screenings so as to ensure that individuals being appointed to the public service – and who have access to government information and assets – are reliable and loyal. Institutions may have additional legislative authorities under which security screening is to be performed. For those institutions not subject to the Financial Administration Act or the Standard , consult the institution's Access to Information Coordinator to determine collection authority.

**Consistent Uses**: Where required, personal information may be shared in accordance with the institution's enabling legislation and within the parameters of the Privacy Act, with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ([Canadian Criminal Real Time Identification Services – RCMP OPS 1214](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/atip-aiprp/infosource/cor-cds-eng.htm) and [Personnel Security Records – RCMP ADM 445](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/atip-aiprp/infosource/cor-cds-eng.htm)) and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ([Security Assessments/Advice Records – CSIS PPU 005](https://www.csis.gc.ca/tp/nfsrc-en.php)) to conduct security screening verifications, inquiries and/or assessments in accordance with the Policy on Government Security.

The security screening status of an individual may be shared internally within institutions with human resource officials to update the individual's personnel file ([Employee Personnel Record – PSE 901](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/atip-aiprp/ai/spib-frpo-eng.asp), [Governor in Council Appointments – PSU 918](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/atip-aiprp/ai/spib-frpo-eng.asp), [Members of Boards Committees and Councils – PSU 919](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/atip-aiprp/ai/spib-frpo-eng.asp)). Information may be shared within or between government institutions for staffing purposes ([Staffing – PSE 902](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/atip-aiprp/ai/spib-frpo-eng.asp)). Information may be shared within institutions with departmental security officials for issuance of access cards and badges ([Physical Access Controls PSU 907](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu907)). Information may be shared within institutions with departmental security officials in cases of adverse information for investigation ([Security – PRN 931](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-classes-records.html) or [Security Incidents and Privacy Breaches – PSU 939](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/atip-aiprp/ai/spib-frpo-eng.asp)). Biographical information, including name, date of birth, employment and/or educational history, may be shared with individuals or entities outside the government institution to confirm identity and conduct required inquiries or verifications including: authorized credit reporting agencies, personal and/or professional referees, and educational institutions and/or professional organizations. Information, including the results of security screening checks, may be disclosed to an individual’s manager, labour relations advisors, and/or an institutional security screening advisory board, on a need to know basis, when a decision to deny, revoke or suspend pending an investigation is being considered. Information, including completed security screening forms, the results of security screening checks and decisions made by a department may be shared between institutional security officials to enable transferability of security screening and to help ensure that individuals are not engaged by another government institution without regard to the circumstances leading to any previous denial or revocation which may have taken place in another institution. Select anonymized information may be used or disclosed for program evaluation.

**Retention and Disposal Standards**: For most government institutions, records will be retained two years following the individual’s departure from the federal public service, or last administrative action, and then destroyed. Record will be retained for ten years in cases of denial or revocation of security status or clearance and then destroyed. For information about the length of time that specific types of common administrative records are maintained by a government institution, including the final disposition of those records, please contact the institution's Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator.
