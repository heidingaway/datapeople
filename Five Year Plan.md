# Five Year Plan
## Savings Plans

1. **Establish Clear Financial Goals:**

    - Define short-term (parental leave), medium-term (university tuition), and long-term (child’s education, family needs) financial priorities.
    - Example: Save $5,000 over 18 months for tuition and $3,000 for an emergency fund.
2. **Automated Savings Strategy:**

    - Set up separate accounts for each goal. Automate monthly transfers (even small amounts) to build consistency.
    - Example: $200/month split into tuition ($120), emergency fund ($50), and RESP ($30).
3. **Expense Tracking:**

    - Use apps like Mint, YNAB, or Excel to monitor spending and identify potential cutbacks (e.g., subscriptions, dining out).
4. **Maximize Government Benefits:**

    - Parental Leave: Ensure you’re receiving all eligible benefits (e.g., Employment Insurance).
    - RESP Matching: Contribute to a RESP to leverage Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) benefits for your child.
5. **Financial Education:**

    - Take a free or affordable online course in personal finance to learn about budgeting, investments, or grants.
    - Example: “Financial Planning for Young Families” on Coursera.

## Study Schedule

1. **Microlearning for Parental Leave:**

    - Break study sessions into short, manageable blocks (10–20 minutes).
    - Tools: Duolingo (French), Quizlet (vocabulary), Anki (concepts related to your field).
2. **Time Mapping:**

    - Identify blocks of free time, such as during naps or after bedtime.
    - Example:
        - Morning (9:00–9:20): Review French vocabulary.
        - Nap time (1:00–1:30): Read an article or watch a webinar.
        - Evening (8:00–9:00): Study a university-related course/module.
3. **Flexible Goals:**

    - Use weekly rather than daily goals to accommodate unpredictable baby care.
4. **Accountability Partners:**

    - Partner with a friend, coworker, or online community for encouragement and shared progress tracking.

## Childcare Options

1. **Flexible/Part-Time Care:**

    - Research part-time daycare, babysitters, or nanny-sharing arrangements that align with your schedule.
    - Example: Two afternoons a week for focused study.
2. **Family Support:**

    - Coordinate with family or trusted friends for occasional childcare help.
3. **Community Programs:**

    - Look into local parent-child programs or libraries for activities that engage your baby while you study nearby.
4. **Cost-Saving Tip:**

    - For occasional care, explore babysitting co-ops where parents trade childcare without payment.
