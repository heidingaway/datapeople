- description: A celebratory and empowering story from young trans activist Gavin Grimm, two-time Stonewall Award-winning and Newbery Honor-winning author Kyle Lukoff, and illustrator J Yang follows the true story of how a young boy stood up for himself--and made history along the way. When you're a kid like Gavin Grimm, you know yourself best. And Gavin knew that he was a boy--even if others saw him as a girl. But when his school took away his right to something as simple as using the boy's restroom, Gavin knew he had a big decision to make. Because there are always more choices than the ones others give you. Gavin chose to correct others when they got his pronouns wrong. He asked to be respected. He stood up for himself. Gavin proved that his school had violated his constitutional rights and had the Supreme Court uphold his case--bringing about a historic win for trans rights. There are many kids out there, some just like Gavin Grimm, and they might even be you. What choices will you make?
