 1. Learn how analogue tools like art and crafts can help teach data literacy in slow, meaningful, and creative ways.

# Think of the last time you felt love...
- did you think of a person?
- how did you know it was happening?
- how did you communicate it to the person? to someone else?
- how might you visualize, map, or explain your experience of love - literally or metaphorically?

# What do we know from Art that is helpful for data-enabled digital transformation?
- no data culture without... culture 
- abstraction
- communication
- emotions
---
# How do we teach a robot about a VUCA world? 
- in the midst of an AI hype cycle, I think it's easy to both fall prey to the promise, but just as easy to overcorrect and dismiss outright
- I think this is probably the wrong question to ask in the first place. 
- How do we teach each other, our children about complexity? 
---
# Abstraction
- distilling complex concepts into its simplest parts
--- 
# The Data Art Workshop
- what did we do? how did it go?
- What are the lessons learned?
---
# The Data Art Field Trip
- how do you explain trauma, reconciliation, colonization?
---
# Data Literacy
- how do you get people to care and connect with data? 
- the most effective way for people to learn is to activate higher level thinking 
- friere: we want to make writers not readers
---
# Activating the learners 
- why should I care about this? Erica example 
- stickiness of stories 
- doing what is necessary to survive is not a culture; cultures grow in communities
---
# The important of play in learning 
- safety to mess up, expertiment, try and fail 
- if you have fun doing data, it becomes easier to do data 
- scream-sleep index makes people laugh
- terry crews go to the gym and don't work out; associate it with fun - positive association so they don't groan when they see a spreadsheet; or social isolation of data practitioners "ya ya nerds"
- you need people to be creative; know the data well enough to experiment, think of new approaches - avoidance is not the way
---
# Who gets to participate in the design of systems?
- inclusion is key to have good systems that capture the range of human emotions
- free speech defined as what a corporation is brave enough to keep up/demonitized. change of language in social settings; how is censorship polluting the data? 
- digital public goods?
---
# Green tangles
- anger, frustration, helplessness and the move toward hope
